## Description
This Tableau project aims to visualize and analyze key financial metrics for the company. We will focus on the following metrics:

1. **Total Revenue**
2. **Paid Users Count**
3. **Average Revenue Per Paid User (ARPPU)**

The project includes a series of charts and tables that provide insights into these metrics, segmented by various dimensions such as time, location, and product. Additionally, a comprehensive dashboard will be created with interactive filters for location, product, and date.

## Metrics and Visualizations

### 1. Total Revenue
   - **Definition**: The total amount of revenue generated within a specific period.
   - **Calculation**: Sum of all revenue transactions.

### 2. Paid Users Count
   - **Definition**: The number of users who have made at least one payment.
   - **Calculation**: Count of unique users who have made a payment.

### 3. Average Revenue Per Paid User (ARPPU)
   - **Definition**: The average revenue generated per paid user.
   - **Calculation**: Total Revenue / Paid Users Count

## Dashboard
A comprehensive dashboard will be created to consolidate all the visualizations. The dashboard will include interactive filters for:
